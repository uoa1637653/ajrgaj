Title: Smooth subgrid fields underpin rigorous closure in spatial
  discretisation of reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs

\\
  Finite difference/element/volume methods of discretising PDEs impose a
subgrid scale interpolation on the dynamics. In contrast, the holistic
discretisation approach developed herein constructs a natural subgrid scale
field adapted to the whole system out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Consequently,
the macroscale discretisation is fully informed by the underlying microscale
dynamics. We establish a new proof that in principle there exists an exact
closure of the dynamics of a general class of reaction-advection-diffusion
PDEs, and show how our approach constructs new systematic approximations to the
in-principle closure starting from a simple, piecewise-linear, continuous
approximation. Under inter-element coupling conditions that guarantee
continuity of several field properties, the holistic discretisation possesses
desirable properties such as a natural cubic spline first-order approximation
to the field, and the self-adjointness of the diffusion operator under
periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann macroscale boundary conditions. As a concrete
example, we demonstrate the holistic discretisation procedure on the well-known
Burgers' PDE, and compare the theoretical and numerical stability of the
resulting discretisation to other approximations. The approach developed here
promises to be able to systematically construct automatically good, macroscale
discretisations to a wide range of PDEs, including wave PDEs.
