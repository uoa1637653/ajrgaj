\maketitle

We are pleased the reviewer found the approach promising, and have addressed the requested clarifications.
\subsubsection*{Remarks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Added a short paragraph to the Introduction to clarify that in general \(U_j(0)\neq u(X_j,0)\).

\item Clarified that \(\nu\) and \(\alpha\) are constant.

\item Detailed the requisite hypotheses of Haragus \& Iooss, with minor changes in symbols to suit, and rephrased the theorem and proof accordingly.  This also clarifies the smoothness conditions on~\(F\) and~\(G\).

\item \S4.2 clarifies that we used \verb|ode15s| from Matlab.

\subsubsection*{Minor remarks}
\setcounter{enumi}{0}

\item As Reviewer spotted, corrected (26).

\item Clarified that (5)--(6) are on a periodic domain and \(j\) is \(N\)-periodic.

\end{enumerate}
