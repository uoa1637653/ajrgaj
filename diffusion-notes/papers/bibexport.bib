The main objective of this paper is not only to present a proper assessment of the previous work but also to provide readers with all fruitful existing information that can help in numerical solution of the Burgers equation, which is otherwise difficult to solve under certain assumptions. Comments are supplied with each reference cited, in order to briefly summarize the objectives of the specific analysis and the important results therein. In addition, a brief discussion of a contribution by the authors in this field has also been presented at the end.},

	Title = {A dynamical systems approach to simulating macroscale spatial dynamics in multiple dimensions},
	Url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1187},
	Volume = {86},
	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new
                   support for the macroscale modelling of \pde{}s and
                   other microscale systems such as Lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators. By
                   systematically resolving subgrid microscale dynamics
                   the dynamical systems approach constructs accurate
                   closures of macroscale discretisations of the
                   microscale system. Here we specifically explore
                   reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions
                   as a prototype of generic systems in multiple
                   dimensions. Our approach unifies into one the
                   modelling of systems by a type of finite elements,
                   and the `equation free' macroscale modelling of
                   microscale simulators efficiently executing only on
                   small patches of the spatial domain. Centre manifold
                   theory ensures that a closed model exist on the
                   macroscale grid, is emergent, and is systematically
                   approximated. Dividing space either into overlapping
                   finite elements or into spatially separated small
                   patches, the specially crafted inter-element/patch
                   coupling also ensures that the constructed
                   discretisations are consistent with the microscale
                   system\slash\pde\ to as high an order as desired.
                   Computer algebra handles the considerable algebraic
                   details as seen in the specific application to the
                   Ginzburg--Landau \pde. However, higher order models
                   in multiple dimensions require a mixed numerical and
                   algebraic approach that is also developed. The
                   modelling here may be straightforwardly adapted to a
                   wide class of reaction-diffusion \pde{}s and lattice
                   equations in multiple space dimensions. When applied
                   to patches of microscopic simulations our coupling
                   conditions promise efficient macroscale simulation.},

	Url = {http://link.aip.org/link/?SCE/29/1495/1},
	Volume = {29},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {We are developing a framework for multiscale
                   computation which enables models at a ``microscopic''
                   level of description, for example, lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo, or molecular dynamics simulators, to
                   perform modeling tasks at ``macroscopic'' length
                   scales of interest. The plan is to use the
                   microscopic rules restricted to small ``patches'' of
                   the domain, the ``teeth,'' using interpolation to
                   bridge the ``gaps.'' Here we explore general boundary
                   conditions coupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of
                   the microscopic simulation that achieve high order
                   accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest
                   case when the microscopic simulator is the
                   quintessential example of a PDE. We argue that
                   classic high order interpolation of the macroscopic
                   field provides the correct forcing in whatever
                   boundary condition is required by the microsimulator.
                   Such interpolation leads to tooth boundary
                   conditions, which achieve arbitrarily high order
                   consistency. The high order consistency is
                   demonstrated on a class of linear PDEs in two ways:
                   first through the eigenvalues of the scheme for
                   selected numerical problems, and second using the
                   dynamical systems approach of holistic discretization
                   on a general class of linear PDEs. Analytic modeling
                   shows that, for a wide class of microscopic systems,
                   the subgrid fields and the effective macroscopic
                   model are largely independent of the tooth size and
                   the particular tooth boundary conditions. When
                   applied to patches of microscopic simulations these
                   tooth boundary conditions promise efficient
                   macroscale simulation. We expect the same approach
                   will also accurately couple patch simulations in
                   higher spatial dimensions.},

	Abstract = {In traditional physicochemical modeling, one derives
                   evolution equations at the (macroscopic, coarse)
                   scale of interest; these are used to perform a
                   variety of tasks (simulation, bifurcation analysis,
                   optimization) using an arsenal of analytical and
                   numerical techniques. For many complex systems,
                   however, although one observes evolution at a
                   macroscopic scale of interest, accurate models are
                   only given at a more detailed (fine-scale,
                   microscopic) level of description (e.g., lattice
                   Boltzmann, kinetic Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics).
                   Here, we review a framework for computer-aided
                   multiscale analysis, which enables macroscopic
                   computational tasks (over extended spatiotemporal
                   scales) using only appropriately initialized
                   microscopic simulation on short time and length
                   scales. The methodology bypasses the derivation of
                   macroscopic evolution equations when these equations
                   conceptually exist but are not available in closed
                   form---hence the term equation-free. We selectively
                   discuss basic algorithms and underlying principles
                   and illustrate the approach through representative
                   applications. We also discuss potential difficulties
                   and outline areas for future research.},

	Abstract = {Arising out of the growing interest in and
                   applications of modern dynamical systems theory, this
                   book explores how to derive relatively simple
                   dynamical equations that model complex physical
                   interactions. The author's objectives are to use
                   sound theory to explore algebraic techniques, develop
                   interesting applications, and discover general
                   modeling principles. Model Emergent Dynamics in
                   Complex Systems unifies into one powerful and
                   coherent approach the many varied extant methods for
                   mathematical model reduction and approximation. Using
                   mathematical models at various levels of resolution
                   and complexity, the book establishes the
                   relationships between such multiscale models and
                   clarifying difficulties and apparent paradoxes and
                   addresses model reduction for systems, resolves
                   initial conditions, and illuminates control and
                   uncertainty. The basis for the author's methodology
                   is the theory and the geometric picture of both
                   coordinate transforms and invariant manifolds in
                   dynamical systems; in particular, center and slow
                   manifolds are heavily used. The wonderful aspect of
                   this approach is the range of geometric
                   interpretations of the modeling process that it
                   produces---simple geometric pictures inspire sound
                   methods of analysis and construction. Further,
                   pictures drawn of state spaces also provide a route
                   to better assess a model's limitations and strengths.
                   Geometry and algebra form a powerful partnership and
                   coordinate transforms and manifolds provide a
                   powerfully enhanced and unified view of a swathe of
                   other complex system modeling methodologies such as
                   averaging, homogenization, multiple scales, singular
                   perturbations, two timing, and WKB theory.},

                   book, which allows readers to explore case studies as
                   well as expository material. The book provides a
                   practical guide to the numerical solution of linear
                   and nonlinear equations, differential equations,
                   optimization problems, and eigenvalue problems. It
                   treats standard problems and introduces important
                   variants such as sparse systems,
                   differential-algebraic equations, constrained
                   optimization, Monte Carlo simulations, and parametric
                   studies. Stability and error analysis is emphasized,
                   and the MATLAB algorithms are grounded in sound
                   principles of software design and in the
                   understanding of machine arithmetic and memory
                   management. Nineteen case studies allow readers to
                   become familiar with mathematical modeling and
                   algorithm design, motivated by problems in physics,
                   engineering, epidemiology, chemistry, and biology. A
                   website provides solutions to the challenges that are
                   offered throughout the book and also supplies
                   relevant MATLAB codes, derivations, and supplementary
                   notes and slides. Audience This book is intended as a
                   primary text for courses in numerical analysis,
                   scientific computing, and computational science for
                   advanced undergraduate and early graduate students.
                   Physicists, chemists, biologists, earth scientists,
                   astronomers, and engineers whose work involves
                   numerical computing also will find the book useful as

                   be effectively predicted by a low-dimensional model
                   that describes the evolution of a reduced set of
                   variables. We consider the question of how to equip
                   such a low-dimensional model with appropriate initial
                   conditions, so that it faithfully reproduces the
                   long-term behaviour of the orginal high-dimensional
                   dynamical system. Our method involves putting the
                   dynamical system into normal form, which not only
                   generates the low-dimensional model, but also
                   provides the correct initital conditions for the
                   model. We illustrate the method with several
                   examples.},

	Abstract = {Just when modern computers (digital, electronic, and
                   programmable) were being invented, John von Neumann
                   and Herman Goldstine wrote a paper to illustrate the
                   mathematical analyses that they believed would be
                   needed to use the new machines effectively and to
                   guide the development of still faster computers.
                   Their foresight and the congruence of historical
                   events made their work the first modern paper in
                   numerical analysis. Von Neumann once remarked that to
                   found a mathematical theory one had to prove the
                   first theorem, which he and Goldstine did for the
                   accuracy of mechanized Gaussian elimination---but
                   their paper was about more than that. Von Neumann and
                   Goldstine described what they surmized would be the
                   significant questions once computers became available
                   for computational science, and they suggested
                   enduring ways to answer them.},
