  abstract =      {Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new
                   support for the macroscale modelling of \pde{}s and
                   other microscale systems such as Lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators. By
                   systematically resolving subgrid microscale dynamics
                   the dynamical systems approach constructs accurate
                   closures of macroscale discretisations of the
                   microscale system. Here we specifically explore
                   reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions
                   as a prototype of generic systems in multiple
                   dimensions. Our approach unifies into one the
                   modelling of systems by a type of finite elements,
                   and the `equation free' macroscale modelling of
                   microscale simulators efficiently executing only on
                   small patches of the spatial domain. Centre manifold
                   theory ensures that a closed model exist on the
                   macroscale grid, is emergent, and is systematically
                   approximated. Dividing space either into overlapping
                   finite elements or into spatially separated small
                   patches, the specially crafted inter-element/patch
                   coupling also ensures that the constructed
                   discretisations are consistent with the microscale
                   system\slash\pde\ to as high an order as desired.
                   Computer algebra handles the considerable algebraic
                   details as seen in the specific application to the
                   Ginzburg--Landau \pde. However, higher order models
                   in multiple dimensions require a mixed numerical and
                   algebraic approach that is also developed. The
                   modelling here may be straightforwardly adapted to a
                   wide class of reaction-diffusion \pde{}s and lattice
                   equations in multiple space dimensions. When applied
                   to patches of microscopic simulations our coupling
                   conditions promise efficient macroscale simulation.},
