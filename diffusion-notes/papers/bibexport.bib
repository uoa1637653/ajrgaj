  abstract =      {Arising out of the growing interest in and
                   applications of modern dynamical systems theory, this
                   book explores how to derive relatively simple
                   dynamical equations that model complex physical
                   interactions. The author's objectives are to use
                   sound theory to explore algebraic techniques, develop
                   interesting applications, and discover general
                   modeling principles. Model Emergent Dynamics in
                   Complex Systems unifies into one powerful and
                   coherent approach the many varied extant methods for
                   mathematical model reduction and approximation. Using
                   mathematical models at various levels of resolution
                   and complexity, the book establishes the
                   relationships between such multiscale models and
                   clarifying difficulties and apparent paradoxes and
                   addresses model reduction for systems, resolves
                   initial conditions, and illuminates control and
                   uncertainty. The basis for the author's methodology
                   is the theory and the geometric picture of both
                   coordinate transforms and invariant manifolds in
                   dynamical systems; in particular, center and slow
                   manifolds are heavily used. The wonderful aspect of
                   this approach is the range of geometric
                   interpretations of the modeling process that it
                   produces---simple geometric pictures inspire sound
                   methods of analysis and construction. Further,
                   pictures drawn of state spaces also provide a route
                   to better assess a model's limitations and strengths.
                   Geometry and algebra form a powerful partnership and
                   coordinate transforms and manifolds provide a
                   powerfully enhanced and unified view of a swathe of
                   other complex system modeling methodologies such as
                   averaging, homogenization, multiple scales, singular
                   perturbations, two timing, and WKB theory.},

  abstract =      {Developments in dynamical systems theory provides new
                   support for the macroscale modelling of \pde{}s and
                   other microscale systems such as Lattice Boltzmann,
                   Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulators. By
                   systematically resolving subgrid microscale dynamics
                   the dynamical systems approach constructs accurate
                   closures of macroscale discretisations of the
                   microscale system. Here we specifically explore
                   reaction-diffusion problems in two spatial dimensions
                   as a prototype of generic systems in multiple
                   dimensions. Our approach unifies into one the
                   modelling of systems by a type of finite elements,
                   and the `equation free' macroscale modelling of
                   microscale simulators efficiently executing only on
                   small patches of the spatial domain. Centre manifold
                   theory ensures that a closed model exist on the
                   macroscale grid, is emergent, and is systematically
                   approximated. Dividing space either into overlapping
                   finite elements or into spatially separated small
                   patches, the specially crafted inter-element/patch
                   coupling also ensures that the constructed
                   discretisations are consistent with the microscale
                   system\slash\pde\ to as high an order as desired.
                   Computer algebra handles the considerable algebraic
                   details as seen in the specific application to the
                   Ginzburg--Landau \pde. However, higher order models
                   in multiple dimensions require a mixed numerical and
                   algebraic approach that is also developed. The
                   modelling here may be straightforwardly adapted to a
                   wide class of reaction-diffusion \pde{}s and lattice
                   equations in multiple space dimensions. When applied
                   to patches of microscopic simulations our coupling
                   conditions promise efficient macroscale simulation.},

                   book, which allows readers to explore case studies as
                   well as expository material. The book provides a
                   practical guide to the numerical solution of linear
                   and nonlinear equations, differential equations,
                   optimization problems, and eigenvalue problems. It
                   treats standard problems and introduces important
                   variants such as sparse systems,
                   differential-algebraic equations, constrained
                   optimization, Monte Carlo simulations, and parametric
                   studies. Stability and error analysis is emphasized,
                   and the MATLAB algorithms are grounded in sound
                   principles of software design and in the
                   understanding of machine arithmetic and memory
                   management. Nineteen case studies allow readers to
                   become familiar with mathematical modeling and
                   algorithm design, motivated by problems in physics,
                   engineering, epidemiology, chemistry, and biology. A
                   website provides solutions to the challenges that are
                   offered throughout the book and also supplies
                   relevant MATLAB codes, derivations, and supplementary
                   notes and slides. Audience This book is intended as a
                   primary text for courses in numerical analysis,
                   scientific computing, and computational science for
                   advanced undergraduate and early graduate students.
                   Physicists, chemists, biologists, earth scientists,
                   astronomers, and engineers whose work involves
                   numerical computing also will find the book useful as
                   a reference and tool for self-study. Table of
