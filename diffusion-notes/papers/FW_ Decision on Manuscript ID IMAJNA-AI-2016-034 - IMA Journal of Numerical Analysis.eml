Okay, so what is our post-rejection approach?

Subject: Decision on Manuscript ID IMAJNA-AI-2016-034 - IMA Journal of Nume=
rical Analysis

Dear Dr. Jarrad,

I write to you in connection with your manuscript # IMAJNA-AI-2016-034 enti=
tled "Smooth subgrid fields underpin rigorous closure in spatial discretisa=
tion of reaction-advection-diffusion PDEs" which you submitted to the IMA J=
ournal of Numerical Analysis.

I am sorry to inform you that in the opinion of the editors your manuscript=
 does not meet the high standards that we currently impose on papers that a=
re published in the IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis. We are therefore una=
ble to consider this manuscript any further for publication in our journal.=
 We believe that in this case, it is better to reject the paper quickly ins=
tead of initiating a lengthy review process.

Let me explain briefly the reasons underlying my decision. The paper is wri=
tten with complete disregard of modern numerical analysis. (Undergraduate t=
exts like Burden & Faires's hardly qualify as modern, grown-up numerical an=
alysis.) Note that the problem is emphatically _not_ that you are using too=
ls, e.g. slow manifolds, which are unfamiliar to most numerical analysts, b=
ut that you are disregarding existing, often exceedingly powerful theory. T=
he most egregious example is your treatment of numerical stability. "Stabil=
ity" in the sense of "stability of numerical methods for PDEs of evolution"=
 is _not_ dynamic stability that you consider, it is structural stability i=
n the sense of "numerical well posedness", which applies not to single disc=
retisation but to an entire hierarchy of discretisations as the spacing of =
the grid goes to zero: this is something we teach our third-year students! =
Your entire approach is, essentially, using adaptivity to produce better so=
lution of a PDE, but you never compare your approach to the many diverse ty=
pes of adaptive methods (h-adaptivity, p-adaptivity and r-adaptivity). You =
prove a numerical method for the Burgers equation - this equation attracted=
 a huge number of different methods because of its special features (shocks=
 and rarefactions) but your approach disregards both the special features o=
f the Burgers equation and all the many competing methods.

I could have sent your paper to an Associate Editor and then to referees bu=
t the only effect would have been a rejection after three-four months. It i=
s better for all concerned to do so rapidly. I honestly suggest that, if yo=
u want to enlighten numerical analysts (and, implicitly, submitting a paper=
 to a numerical journal implies this) you should first make the effort to l=
earn the current state of the art in the subject and persuade your readers =
that your approach improves upon it.=20

Thank you for considering the IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis for the pub=
lication of your research.

Sincerely,
Prof. Arieh Iserles
Editor-in-Chief, IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis ai@damtp.cam.ac.uk
